# PUMP — Claude Code Context

## What this app is
A mobile-first PWA workout tracker for Dylan's personal use, deployed at
**pump.dylandibona.com**. It is one half of the **PUMP OS** — a training system
where a Claude Health Project acts as a remote trainer and this app acts as the
gym executor. See `../trainer-os/README.md` for the full system spec.

## Architecture in one line
Next.js 16 App Router, offline-first client (all data in localStorage),
local-first with cloud sync — **mid-migration from Upstash Redis to Supabase**
(DD Health project). Deployed via GitHub → Vercel. See `pump_build_spec_v2.md`
for the cutover plan.

## Design / look & feel
See **`DESIGN.md`** at the project root for the Volume System (the current
design philosophy). `MOCKUP_AUDIT.md` is the living punch list of what's
shipped vs. open. The mockup gallery is at `/mockup` (dev route); the design
token reference is at `/design` (dev route). v1 *Miami Heat Wave* is archived
at `_archive/DESIGN_SYSTEM_v1.md`.

## Key files to know

### Data + state
- `src/lib/types.ts` — all data types incl. PUMP OS types. `PersonalRecord`
  carries `e1rm` + `previousWeight`/`previousReps`. `WorkoutSession` carries
  `feelScore` + `prSummary` (for the Supabase session write).
- `src/lib/storage.ts` — localStorage operations + plan storage + PR commit
  logic. Exports `computeE1RM` (Epley) and `isWorkingSet`. PRs commit once at
  completion via `finalizePRs`. Session finalization helpers:
  `finalizeSession`, `finishOrDiscardSession`, `finalizeAbandonedSessions`,
  `dissolveBrokenSupersets`, `sessionDurationMin`.
- `src/lib/utils.ts` — pure helpers including `parseSessionDate` (avoids the
  UTC-rolling bug on YYYY-MM-DD strings) and **`sessionLabel(s, plan)`** — the
  one canonical display name for a session (prefers plan-session name via
  `planSessionId`, falls back to capitalized type). Used by Dashboard recent
  rows, History list, and Session detail.
- `src/lib/exercises.ts` — exercise library + `normalizeExerciseName()`. One
  source of truth applied at every entry point so names like "Curl standing
  curl" → "Standing Curl" canonicalize on write.
- `src/lib/brief.ts` — generates the trainer BRIEF from a session (resolves
  plan session by `planSessionId`).
- `src/lib/sounds.ts` — Web Audio API playback (PR / set-complete sounds mix
  over music instead of ducking iOS audio session).

### Cloud / sync
- `src/lib/supabase.ts` — browser client (`@supabase/supabase-js`).
  `isSupabaseConfigured` gates everything; never constructs a client without
  env vars.
- `src/lib/plan-sync.ts` — `fetchActivePlan()` pulls the active plan from the
  Supabase `plans` table (where `is_active`), validates, saves to the
  `dylan-workout-plan` key. Primary plan path; PlanLoader paste is the
  fallback.
- `src/lib/session-sync.ts` — `pushUnsyncedSessions()` reconciliation sweep.
  Single-flight guard prevents concurrent double-fires. `client_session_id`
  (UUID minted on session start) is the idempotency key — duplicate writes
  hit the partial unique index, caught as `23505` and marked synced (first
  complete write wins, no second row). Native `GymExercise[]` shape preserved.
- `src/lib/prs-sync.ts` — fetches the **curated `prs` Supabase table** (clean
  exercise / weight / reps / unit / kind / achieved_on). Cached locally for
  instant first paint. Dashboard Records read from here; local PersonalRecord
  store is kept only for in-session "NEW BEST" detection (labeled "best",
  not "PR", to avoid the offline latency gap).
- `src/lib/bp-sync.ts` — `pushUnsyncedBP()` mirror for blood-pressure
  readings → Supabase `bp_readings`.
- `src/components/auth/AuthGate.tsx` — wraps the app in `layout.tsx`.
  **Hard-gates** behind magic-link login when `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_*` are
  set; falls through (ungated, localStorage-only) when unset. Splash + sign-in
  both use `pump-scene-empty.png` (dark dumbbell scene) + `letspump3-transparent.png`
  (brushy "Let's Pump!" wordmark) so the loading→form transition is seamless.

### Cloud sync — Upstash Redis (legacy, Phase-2 removal pending)
- `src/app/api/data/route.ts` — sync endpoint. Returns 503 until env vars set.
- `src/lib/sync-merge.ts` — pure, isomorphic merge (union by id, heavier PRs,
  LWW on settings/plan).
- `src/lib/sync.ts` — client layer; one round trip = bidirectional sync.
- `src/hooks/useCloudSync.ts` — app-wide bootstrap (initial sync, debounced
  push, throttled focus refresh). Status surface (`CloudSyncCard`) is hidden
  on the dashboard now; the component is still in the tree for cleanup.

### View state + nav
- `src/app/page.tsx` — view state machine, plan state, tab-bar routing
  (`'workout' | 'history' | 'plan'`), in-file `PlanView` + `SessionDetailView`
  subcomponents. **Floating glass-pill back button** (sticky, fades in on
  scroll past 60px) lives here so the back action is always reachable
  without resorting to the browser back button.
- `src/app/layout.tsx` — root layout, font loading (Monoton + Pacifico +
  Outfit; **Space Mono retired** — `--font-mono` resolves to Outfit).

### Surfaces (components/workout/)
- `Dashboard.tsx` — home. Hero banner → plan chip + inline BP heart button
  → "Let's Go" CTA → 3 stat cards (warm-tint via `.surface-warm`, Records
  tile gets `.surface-warm--hot`) → Recent rows (via `sessionLabel`) →
  Latest PR dark-motif card (Pacifico + tabular weight + cyan horizon)
  followed by next-best PRs list. First-run empty state is a full-bleed
  `pump-scene-beach.png` scene card ("Ready when you are" / Pacifico "Log
  your first set") — taps through to start a workout.
- `GymWorkout.tsx` — most complex. Exercises, supersets, bodyweight, inline
  cardio, plan pre-fill. Triggers `PRMomentScreen` when `newPRs` grows.
- `SessionPreview.tsx` — editable preview between plan-session tap and
  GymWorkout.
- `SessionSummary.tsx` — post-workout. "Synced to trainer" reassurance band,
  named feel rating (Brutal / Tough / OK / Good / Easy → `feel_score` +
  BRIEF), primary Pacifico "Done" CTA (honest — data's already in Supabase),
  secondary "Open with trainer" copies the brief.
- `PRMomentScreen.tsx` — V3 full-screen PR reward: `pump-pr-burst.png`
  backdrop + `new-PR.png` wordmark + Pacifico exercise name + Outfit-tabular
  weight overlay.
- `CardioWorkout.tsx` — multi-activity logger. Activity picker (run/bike/swim/
  row/elliptical/walk) stays; styling adopted Volume System tokens. Opens with
  `CardioSceneHeader` (cinematic cockpit, mockup §05) in place of the old inline
  countdown/stopwatch `Timer` card; owns the session-local renameable session
  name + computes the header's duration/distance totals.
- `CardioSceneHeader.tsx` — the **cinematic cardio cockpit** (mockup §05): a
  full-bleed `pump-scene-cardio.png` neon-highway band with cyan
  "CARDIO · \<activity\>" caps, an inline-editable Pacifico session name (cardio
  has no persisted name field — derived default, renamed via the pencil, held in
  CardioWorkout state), and a giant Outfit-tabular hero timer at the vanishing
  point = **total logged duration**, flanked by live distance + pace. The cardio
  counterpart to `WorkoutTimerBar`; the logger is unchanged below it.
- `BottomTabBar.tsx` — persistent root nav. Hidden on workflow views (start,
  preview, gym, cardio, summary, session-detail).
- `BloodPressureSheet.tsx` + `src/lib/bp-sync.ts` — non-workout BP recorder.
  Dashboard heart button → bottom sheet (LOG / RECENT toggle, SYS/DIA/pulse,
  time, lisinopril toggle + how-long-ago buckets, notes, live AHA category;
  "Copy last N for doctor" exports plain text for PCP).
- `PlanLoader.tsx` — parses trainer JSON (manual fallback to the Supabase
  plan fetch), shows plan details. Mounted inside the Plan tab view.
- `ReorderExercisesSheet.tsx` — dedicated reorder surface (framer `Reorder`);
  commits via `useWorkout.reorderExercises`, which auto-unlinks supersets
  moved out of adjacency.
- `WorkoutHistory.tsx` — month-grouped list. Calm white cards, sentence-case
  via `sessionLabel`, demoted Delete affordance.
- `WorkoutTimerBar.tsx` — the **atmospheric cockpit header** (mockup §02):
  a cropped `pump-scene-gym.png` band carrying the session meta (cyan caps,
  e.g. "Push Day · 2 of 6 done"), the up-next exercise in Pacifico, the live
  elapsed clock, and the rest controls — quick presets or a live countdown
  that pulses (`glow-state--urgent`) in its final seconds. Sticky to the top
  of the scroll container. All timer logic is unchanged from the old light
  bar; only the presentation moved onto the scene. (Props: `metaLabel`,
  `exerciseName`, computed in GymWorkout.)
- `Timer.tsx` — countdown + stopwatch. `RestTimerInline` exported for use
  inside GymWorkout.
- `IntervalFlow.tsx` — interval timer builder + runner.
- `RetrowaveScene.tsx` — **retired/orphaned.** Was the old brand hero before
  `pump-header.png`. Kept on disk for now. Asset references (palms +
  reference HTML) live in `_archive/`.

### UI primitives
- `src/components/ui/sheet.tsx` — base Sheet. **Overlay Contract enforced
  here:** bottom/top sheets inline-style height to `90dvh` so consumers
  inherit a viewport-clamped sheet by default. Default close button is a
  44px+ touch target at top-right (`z-10` above content).

### Dev surfaces (behind auth gate; not linked from UI)
- `src/app/mockup/page.tsx` — visual gallery of every designed screen.
  Source of truth for design intent.
- `src/app/design/page.tsx` — Volume System token reference (typography,
  surfaces, glow-as-state, status colors).

## localStorage keys
- `dylan-workout-tracker` — all sessions, PRs, templates, settings
- `dylan-workout-plan` — active TrainerPlan JSON (separate key, replaced on
  plan update)
- `pump-prs-cache` — curated `prs` snapshot for instant first paint
- `pump-synced-sessions` / `pump-bp-synced` — ids already written to Supabase
  (sweep dedup)
- `pump-bp-readings` — blood-pressure readings (local store; synced to
  `bp_readings`)
- `pump-sync-token` / `pump-sync-last` — Upstash bearer token + last-sync
  timestamp (legacy)
- Supabase auth session — stored by `supabase-js` under its own `sb-*` key
  (one-time magic-link login auto-restores)

## Env vars (Vercel project)
- **Supabase (Phase 1+):** `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`,
  `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` — inlined at build time (set in Vercel +
  **redeploy**).
  ⚠️ Setting these turns on the AuthGate hard-gate, so configure the
  **Supabase Auth → URL redirect allowlist** (localhost + pump.dylandibona.com)
  *first* to avoid lockout. Tighten the placeholder RLS to `auth.uid()` after
  first login.
- **Upstash (legacy):** `SYNC_TOKEN`, `KV_REST_API_URL` / `KV_REST_API_TOKEN`
  (or `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_*`). Removed in Phase 2.

## PUMP OS data flow
```
TRAINER (Claude Health Project / coach via MCP)
  → publishes active plan to Supabase `plans` (is_active = true)
  → PUMP fetchActivePlan() pulls it on load → saves to dylan-workout-plan
    (PlanLoader paste still works as a manual fallback)
  → maintains the curated `prs` table; PUMP's dashboard Records reads from it

User taps session → SessionPreview (plan sessions) → GymWorkout pre-fills
  → logs actual sets (weight overrideable)
  → the instant a set sets a new best (newPRs grows): PRMomentScreen
    full-screen reward fires in-session (sound + burst + "up from")
  → completes session

On completion:
  → SessionSummary generates BRIEF + captures named feel (Brutal/…/Easy)
  → session-sync sweep writes a row to Supabase `sessions`
     (raw_brief, feel_score, native GymExercise[], client_session_id UUID)
  → idempotent — duplicate writes hit unique index, caught as 23505
  → BRIEF copied to clipboard via "Open with trainer" (secondary action)
```

## Active design decisions (current)

- **Volume System (v2)** — every component belongs to a volume.
  - **V3 (rare, earned, loud):** hero, primary CTAs, PR moment, workout-complete.
  - **V2 (ambient chrome):** titles, labels, tab bar, tags, card trim — loud but flat.
  - **V1 (the cockpit):** set rows, inputs, list rows — calm + neon-trimmed.
  - **Glow is a state, not a texture.** Resting cards do not glow.
  - Full doc: **`DESIGN.md`**.
- **Type system: one family with three registers + two display fonts.**
  Monoton (brand mark only), Pacifico (named moments), Outfit (everything
  else: caps tracked for chrome, sentence-case for body, `tabular-nums` for
  numbers). **Space Mono retired.** `font-mono` className auto-falls-through
  to Outfit via `--font-mono`.
- **Brand assets** — dashboard hero is `pump-header.png` (neon cursive on a
  retrowave scene). Sign-in is `pump-scene-empty.png` + `letspump3-transparent.png`.
  PR moment is `pump-pr-burst.png` + `new-PR.png`. Inventory in `DESIGN.md §7`.
- **Auth gate (Supabase)** — `AuthGate` hard-gates the whole app behind
  magic-link login when `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_*` are set; ungated/
  localStorage-only when unset. Single user. Health data, so RLS + an authed
  session are the only protection (publishable key is public).
- **Floating back-button pill** — sticky in the top-left, fades in on scroll
  past 60px. Always reachable mid-workout so the user never reaches for the
  browser back button.
- **Bottom tab bar** — Workout / History / Plan. Hidden on workflow views.
- **`sessionLabel` is the canonical display name** — prefer plan-session
  name (matched by `planSessionId`), fall back to capitalized type. Applied
  on Dashboard recent rows, History list, Session detail.
- **Records read from curated Supabase `prs` table.** Local PRs are kept
  only for in-session detection ("NEW BEST" badge).
- **Sessions finish reliably (Pass 1 / "4a" fix)** — leaving an active
  session via Back **auto-finishes** it when anything was logged; empty
  shells are discarded; a cold-mount sweep cleans pre-existing orphans.
  `completeSession` reads fresh from storage so it never silently no-ops.
- **Mid-workout reorder** — dedicated reorder sheet (not inline drag); each
  exercise carries its own `sets[]` so logged data travels with the card.
  Moving a superset member out of adjacency auto-unlinks it
  (`dissolveBrokenSupersets`).
- **Session feel** — named 1–5 rating on the summary (Brutal / Tough / OK /
  Good / Easy); feeds `feel_score` (Supabase) and a `FEEL:` line in the BRIEF.
- **Cardio cinematic moment = a cockpit header, not a separate splash.** The
  mockup's §05 cinematic cardio screen ships as `CardioSceneHeader` atop the
  multi-activity logger (mirroring the gym cockpit, §02), not as a transient
  start-splash. Its hero timer is the **total logged duration** (the cardio
  banked), not a wall clock — honest for the post-hoc, entry-by-entry logging
  model. Session name is session-local + renameable (no persisted field, no
  Supabase/BRIEF churn). The logger (activity picker + entries) is unchanged.
- **"Synced to trainer" reassurance** — workout-complete shows a band:
  "Your trainer sees this in their dashboard. No paste needed." The primary
  CTA is "Done" (honest — the Supabase write already happened); secondary
  "Open with trainer" copies the BRIEF for explicit conversation.
- **Cloud sync is offline-first + additive** — localStorage stays the source
  of truth. Supabase (Phase 1) is additive: auth + plan fetch + session writes.
  Upstash sync still runs alongside (Phase 2 retires it). Upstash merge is
  union-based with no tombstones, so a deleted item can reappear from another
  device (acceptable until Phase 2). Both layers are inert when their env
  vars are unset.
- **Script-font nav titles on root views** — Plan, History, New Workout render
  their nav title in Pacifico (title-case). Workflow views keep Outfit 800
  uppercase.
- **PR logic: per-set Epley e1RM** — `e1RM = weight × (1 + min(reps,30)/30)`.
  Local detection only powers the in-session "NEW BEST" badge; the trainer
  curates the canonical PRs in the Supabase `prs` table.
- **Exercise names are canonicalized at every write site.**
  `normalizeExerciseName()` is applied to `addExercise`, `bulkAddExercises`,
  plan import, autocomplete commit, and `finalizePRs`. A one-time backfill
  on `getWorkoutData()` heals legacy malformed names on load.
- **Sound uses Web Audio API** — AudioContext + BufferSource so PR / set-
  complete sounds layer over music instead of claiming iOS audio session.
- **Overlay Contract enforced at the `Sheet` primitive** — every bottom sheet
  inherits a viewport-clamped height (`90dvh`), pinned header/footer, single
  inner scroll region, and a ≥44px reachable close.

## How to deploy
Push to `main` on GitHub. Vercel auto-deploys. No manual steps for code.
Env-var changes (Upstash or Supabase keys) only take effect on a **fresh
deploy** — redeploy after editing them. **Supabase rollout ordering:**
configure the Auth redirect-URL allowlist *before* setting
`NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_*` in Vercel, or the AuthGate locks you out.

## Keeping docs current (standing directive)
Docs are part of the change, not an afterthought. End every session with the
docs matching reality:
- Update **CLAUDE.md** in the same pass — architecture line, key files, active
  design decisions, localStorage keys, env vars.
- Tick/raise items in **BACKLOG.md**; keep **README.md**'s feature list +
  tech stack honest.
- Update **DESIGN.md** when a token, register, or volume rule changes.
- Update **MOCKUP_AUDIT.md** as items ship — it's the living punch list, not
  a one-time doc.
- Move shipped specs / superseded docs to **`_archive/`** with a one-line
  entry in `_archive/README.md`. Don't let stale docs sit in the root.

## Trainer OS docs
All system documentation lives in `../trainer-os/`. Don't duplicate that
context here.
